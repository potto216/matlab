function correspDisplay(corresps, im, col)
%correspDisplay Display image correspondences
%   correspDisplay(CORRESPS, IM) takes CORRESPS, a set of matches as
%   returned by correlCorresp, and an image IM. Vectors are drawn on the
%   image representing the motion of the features. The point at which the
%   feature is initially located is marked with a circle and a motion
%   vector is shown as a line pointing away from the circle.
%
%   correspDisplay(CORRESPS, REGION) where REGION is a row vector, draws
%   the vectors in the current figure without setting a background. REGION
%   can have 4 elements and specifies the region in which to draw vectors
%   in the format [Ymin Ymax Xmin Xmax]. REGION may have 2 elements giving
%   [Ymax Xmax]; Ymin and Xmin both default to 1. Thus correspDisplay(FLOW,
%   SIZE(IM)) displays the flow for an image on a blank canvas.
%
%   correspDisplay(..., COL) sets the colour in which to draw the vectors.
%   COL must be a single colour character, as for PLOT.
