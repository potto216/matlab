% SF Sticks Filtering
%    SF(I,N,K) Sticks filtering for speckle noise reduction
%    This filter works for greyscale images
%
%    I is the image to be filtered
%    N is the size of the filter
%    K is the sticks thickness

% Using sticks filters to reduce speckle noise : exemples.
%   Increasing “stick” length leads to a more smoothly filtered image, 
%   at the expense of weakly highlighting tightly bound curves - a
%   result of the “stick” being longer than some of the boundary edges. 
%   Similarly, thicker “sticks” suppress more noise the expense of making
%   thin boundaries less visible. A thick “stick” can be used to smooth 
%   noise similar to a low-pass filter, with the addition of highlighting 
%   broad region differences.
